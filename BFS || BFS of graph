Did this myself . small mistake was that i was marking visited while dequeing , i should have marked an element visited as soon as it enters the queue only as below 



class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to return Breadth First Traversal of given graph.
    vector<int> bfs(vector<vector<int>> &adj) 
    {
        vector<int> visited (adj.size(),0);
        vector<int> result;
        queue<int> q;
        
        q.push(0);
        visited[0] = 1;
        
        while(!q.empty())
        {
            int curr = q.front();
            for(int i =0;i< adj[curr].size() ; i++)
            {
                if(visited[adj[curr][i]] == 0)
                {
                    q.push(adj[curr][i]);
                    visited[adj[curr][i]] = 1;
                }
                    
            }
            result.push_back(curr);
            q.pop();
        }
        return result;
    }
};
