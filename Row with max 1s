THIS IS NOT BINARY SEARCH LOL ,This uses normal search with optimization.
Optimization can happen because row wise , things are in ascending order
This method is known as "STAIRCASE SEARCH"


// User function template for C++
class Solution {
  public:
    int rowWithMax1s(vector<vector<int>> &arr) 
    {
        int result = -1;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while(arr[i][j] != 1 && j<arr[i].size()) // This is very important here as even if j is greater than the number or columns, error will not come array will just pick elements from next row which will create problems.
            j++;
            
        if(j == arr[0].size())
            j--;
        else
            result = 0;
        
        while( j>=0 && i<arr.size() )
        {
            if(arr[i][j] == 1)
            {
                result = i;
                j--;
            }
            else
                i++;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
