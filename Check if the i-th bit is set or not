Firstly left shift to bring a new variable to have only one 1 at kth place
and gate used to figure out whether there is a 1 at that place , if result is 1 , the kth bit has 1


class Solution {
  public:
    bool checkKthBit(int n, int k) 
    {
        int dummy = 1;
        dummy = dummy << k;
        if(n & dummy >= 1)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }
};
