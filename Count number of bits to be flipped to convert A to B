XOR it and count the number of 1's in the answer 
XOR will give the 1 if there is difference in bit .Leading zeroes aint a problem as XOR 1 w 0 will give 1 and XOR of 0 with 0 is 0 and it will not be a problem only;



class Solution {
public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) 
    {
        int res = start ^ goal ;
        int length = 0;
        while(res > 0)
        {
            if(res%2 == 1)
                length++;
            res = res>>1;
        }
        return length;
    }
};
