//One thing i can think of is maintaining an another array with the elements in this stack in the ascending order , THis doesnt work with popping

//Other approach is making a stack of pair where the first is the element that is being pushed and second will the smallest element .
//This gives space complexity of O(2*n)
NOT YET DONE < WILL DO LATER
