CONCEPT : Run loop form 2 to root(n);
check if the numbers is divisible by i, if divisibile ,put a while loop and divide as much as possible ;

alternate method is to check whehter a number is divisible and checking isPrime for all the numbers divisible.



class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> primeFac(int n) 
    {
        vector<int> factors;
        int actual = n;
        for(int i = 2 ;i*i<= actual;i++)
        {
            if(n%i == 0)
                factors.push_back(i);
            while(n%i == 0)
                n = n/i;
        }
        if(n!=1)
            factors.push_back(n);
        return factors;
    }
};
